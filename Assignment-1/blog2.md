Why are Type Guards Necessary? Discuss Various Types of Type Guards and Their Use Cases.

Type guards in TypeScript are a way to help the compiler understand the specific type of a variable at a given point in the code. This is especially useful in TypeScript because it allows for safer and more predictable behavior when working with complex data. Type guards are essential because they enable the following:

Error Prevention: Type guards allow the TypeScript compiler to catch potential type-related errors before the code runs, making the code more reliable.

Code Clarity: They improve readability, as they explicitly state what type of data we’re working with, making it easier to understand how different types are handled.

Increased Flexibility: By knowing the type of a variable at different points, you can write more flexible and reusable functions and methods.
Types of Type Guards and Their Use Cases

type Type Guard:
The typeof operator checks if a variable is of a certain primitive type, like string, number, or boolean.
2. Use Case: When you want to handle primitive types differently in your function.
2. instanceof Type Guard:
The instanceof operator checks if an object is an instance of a specific class or constructor.
Use Case: When you want to differentiate between instances of classes.

3. Custom Type Guards (Using Functions):
Custom type guards allow you to create specific checks for your types. You use the is keyword in a function’s return type to make it a type guard.
Use Case: When you have more complex types and want a reusable function to check for a specific type.

4. in Type Guard:
The in operator checks if a property exists in an object.
Use Case: When dealing with objects that may or may not have specific properties.
